AI-Powered APT Simulation Framework
# AI-Powered Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Simulation Framework

## Overview
The AI-Powered Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Simulation Framework is a comprehensive tool designed to simulate sophisticated adversary behaviors, automate multi-stage attacks, and adapt based on target defenses using reinforcement learning. This framework is ideal for red teamers aiming to evaluate and enhance their security measures against advanced, evolving threats.

## Features
- **Target Reconnaissance**: AI-driven OSINT and network scanning
- **Initial Access**: Techniques like phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities, and credential stuffing
- **Command and Control (C2)**: Robust infrastructure for controlling compromised machines
- **Lateral Movement**: Automated techniques for moving within the network
- **Persistence**: Establish long-term access on compromised machines
- **Data Exfiltration**: Simulate data exfiltration techniques
- **Adaptation and Learning**: Reinforcement learning to adapt attack strategies
- **Real-time Monitoring and Reporting**: Live attack monitoring and detailed reports

## Project Roadmap

### Milestone 1: Project Setup and Initial Reconnaissance

#### Week 1-2: Initial Setup
- [ ] Set up the project repository on GitHub.
- [ ] Create a virtual environment for the project.
- [ ] Install necessary libraries and tools (`scapy`, `shodan`, `tensorflow`, `flask`, `dash`).

#### Week 2-3: Reconnaissance Module
- [ ] Implement OSINT data collection using Shodan API.
- [ ] Develop a script to perform domain reconnaissance.
- [ ] Create initial documentation for the reconnaissance module.

### Milestone 2: Initial Access Techniques

#### Week 4-5: Phishing Simulation
- [ ] Develop a script to send phishing emails.
- [ ] Implement a basic phishing landing page.
- [ ] Create tests to verify the functionality of the phishing module.

#### Week 5-6: Exploit Development
- [ ] Implement common exploits using Metasploit.
- [ ] Develop custom exploit scripts for specific vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Document the exploitation process.

### Milestone 3: Command and Control (C2) Infrastructure

#### Week 7-8: C2 Server Setup
- [ ] Set up a Flask-based C2 server.
- [ ] Implement WebSocket communication for real-time command and control.
- [ ] Create registration and command endpoints for compromised machines.

#### Week 8-9: Client Integration
- [ ] Develop a client script to communicate with the C2 server.
- [ ] Implement basic commands for the client (e.g., execute, upload, download).
- [ ] Document the C2 infrastructure.

### Milestone 4: Lateral Movement and Persistence

#### Week 10-11: Lateral Movement
- [ ] Implement techniques for lateral movement (e.g., pass-the-hash, pass-the-ticket).
- [ ] Automate lateral movement scripts.

#### Week 11-12: Persistence Mechanisms
- [ ] Develop scripts for establishing persistence (e.g., registry modifications, scheduled tasks).
- [ ] Test and validate persistence mechanisms.
- [ ] Document the lateral movement and persistence modules.

### Milestone 5: Data Exfiltration Techniques

#### Week 13-14: Data Exfiltration
- [ ] Develop scripts for data exfiltration using various methods (e.g., DNS tunneling, HTTP).
- [ ] Implement data exfiltration tests to verify the effectiveness of the scripts.
- [ ] Document the data exfiltration process.

### Milestone 6: AI and Reinforcement Learning Integration

#### Week 15-16: AI for Reconnaissance
- [ ] Implement machine learning algorithms for automated reconnaissance.
- [ ] Train models to improve reconnaissance accuracy.

#### Week 17-18: Reinforcement Learning for Adaptation
- [ ] Implement reinforcement learning to adapt attack strategies.
- [ ] Train models using custom environments to simulate security defenses.
- [ ] Document the AI integration process.

### Milestone 7: Real-time Monitoring and Reporting

#### Week 19-20: Monitoring Dashboard
- [ ] Set up a Dash-based web dashboard for real-time monitoring.
- [ ] Implement data visualization for attack progress and outcomes.

#### Week 21-22: Reporting Module
- [ ] Develop scripts to generate detailed reports of attack activities.
- [ ] Integrate reporting with the monitoring dashboard.
- [ ] Document the monitoring and reporting modules.

### Milestone 8: Final Testing and Documentation

#### Week 23-24: Final Testing
- [ ] Conduct comprehensive testing of all modules.
- [ ] Fix any bugs and optimize performance.
- [ ] Ensure all documentation is up-to-date.

#### Week 25: Project Completion
